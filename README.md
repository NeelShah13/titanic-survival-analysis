# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to uncover hidden survival patterns and demonstrate **data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling with data**.  

This project aligns with my passion for **Data Science, Analytics, and uncovering patterns in real-world datasets**.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Gender**: Women had a survival rate of ~74%, men only ~19%.  
- **Class**: 1st Class passengers had ~62% survival vs 24% in 3rd Class.  
- **Age**: Children (<10 years) had better survival chances.  
- **Family Size**: People with small families had better chances than those traveling alone.
